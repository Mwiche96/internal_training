"""Model Initialisation

See also https://model.energy.

**In this section, we will build a replica of [model.energy](https://model.energy).**
This tool calculates the cost of meeting a constant electricity demand from a combination
of wind power, solar power and storage for different regions of the world.

We deviate from [model.energy](https://model.energy) by including offshore wind generation
and electricity demand profiles rather than a constant electricity demand. Also, we are going
to start with Germany only. You can adapt the code to other countries as an exercise.
